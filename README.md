# basicProjects-Guides

This is the main repository that contains all my personal projects/guides that were used during my own learning journey. Different guides over itnernet are generally very specific to one thing or another. The projects here are more structured towards university projects, where different competences learned are interlinked. 

This repository if for all beginners/somewhat intermediate developers. You can reproduce any of the project present here as no license is attached to any of the programs found within this repository.

I would advise not to simply copy/paste projects (including for homeworks) as it will not allow you to acquire any skill. You are more than encourages to personalize any project there as it covers the very basics. This will also allow you to learn more things. 

Different type of programs can be found within these repository.

As it represents my own learning journey and my acquired skill during my coding experience, there is no set structure. Projects made on different languages/technologies are present.

You can find in this repository:
- GUI dony wiht python tkinter.
- projects made for a specific algorithm.
- basic projects to learn html/css/JS
- projects to use PHP & MYSQL.

Projects currently done under confidentiality for clients/company are not found in this repository, I might add some simple projects to showcase the skills used during those projects.

I personally used different guides on internet while leanring these skill sets and tried my maximum to refer all of them in my project. Please do so also when you can as supporting these guides will allow the chance to more people to get to know all the contributors and help the creation of other guides.
