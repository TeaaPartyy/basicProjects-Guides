Project done by Hamza Slaoui Habib.

This project is a basic simulation of Netflix.

Using Netflix as an example, this project will allow you to create the same frontpage and a basic sign in/sign up & sign out form.

From this you can also learn how to show content depending if the user is connected or not.

No licences or rights are owned by me, this is a source free code used in order to learn.
